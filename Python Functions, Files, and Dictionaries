week 1


The textfile, travel_plans.txt, contains the summer travel plans for someone with some commentary. Find the total number of characters in the file and save to the variable num.

file = open('travel_plans.txt', 'r')
read = file.read()
num = 0
for i in read:
    num += 1
print(num)




We have provided a file called emotion_words.txt that contains lines of words that describe emotions. Find the total number of words in the file and assign this value to the variable num_words.

file = open('emotion_words.txt', 'r')
read = file.read()
words = read.split()

num_words = 0
for i in words:
    num_words += 1
print(num_words)




Assign to the variable num_lines the number of lines in the file school_prompt.txt.

file = open('school_prompt.txt','r')
lines = file.readlines()
num_lines = 0
for i in lines:
    num_lines += 1
print(num_lines)


Assign the first 30 characters of school_prompt.txt as a string to the variable beginning_chars.

file = open('school_prompt.txt','r')
v = file.read()
beginning_chars = v[:30]




Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, assign the third word of every line to a list called three.

file = open('school_prompt.txt','r')
v = file.readlines()
three = []
n = 0
for i in v:
    n += 1
    three.insert(n, i.split()[2])
print(three)




Challenge: Create a list called emotions that contains the first word of every line in emotion_words.txt.
n = 0
emotions = []

with open('emotion_words.txt','r') as file: 
    for line in file:
        n += 1
        emotions.insert(n, line.split()[0])



Assign the first 33 characters from the textfile, travel_plans.txt to the variable first_chars.

with open('travel_plans.txt','r') as file:
    first_chars = file.read()[:33]




Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, if the character ‘p’ is in a word, then add the word to a list called p_words.

file = open('school_prompt.txt','r')
words = file.read().strip().split()
print(words)

p_words = []
n = 0
for i in words:
    if ('p' in i):
        n += 1
        p_words.insert(n, i)
