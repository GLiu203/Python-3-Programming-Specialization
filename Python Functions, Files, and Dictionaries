for key in keys:
    if characters[key] > characters[best_char]:
        best_char= key
    


Find the least frequent letter. Create the dictionary characters that shows each character from string sally and its frequency. Then, find the least frequent letter in the string and assign the letter to the variable worst_char.
sally = "sally sells sea shells by the sea shore and by the road"

characters ={}
for i in sally:
    if i not in characters :

for key in keys:
    if characters[key]<characters[worst_char]:
        worst_char=key
print(worst_char)


Create a dictionary named letter_counts that contains each letter and the number of times it occurs in string1. Challenge: Letters should not be counted separately as upper-case and lower-case. Intead, all of them should be counted as lower-case.
string1 = "There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures."
string2=string1.lower()
letter_counts={}
for i in string2:
    if i not in letter_counts:
        letter_counts[i]=0
    letter_counts[i]+=1


Create a dictionary called low_d that keeps track of all the characters in the string p and notes how many times each character was seen. Make sure that there are no repeats of characters as keys, such that “T” and “t” are both seen as a “t” for example.
p = "Summer is a great time to go outside. You have to be careful of the sun though because of the heat."
p2=p.lower()

low_d={}
for i in p2:
    if i not in low_d:

    return x
int_return(4)



Write a function called add that takes any number as its input and returns that sum with 2 added.
def add(x):
    sum = x +2
    return sum
add(4)


Write a function called change that takes any string, adds “Nice to meet you!” to the end of the argument given, and returns that new string.

    new = x + 'Nice to meet you!'
    return new
change('Ali')



Write a function, accum, that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of those integers.
def accum(list):
    sum = 0
    for i in list:
        sum+=i
    return sum
list=[1,2]



Write a function, length, that takes in a list as the input. If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 5, return “Longer than 5”. If the length is less than 5, return “Less than 5”.
def length(list):
    if len(list) >= 5:
        return 'Longer than 5'
    else:
        return 'Less than 5'
list=[2,3,5,6,7,8]
length(list)



You will need to write two functions for this problem. The first function, divide that takes in any number and returns that same number divided by 2. The second function called sum should take any number, divide it by 2, and add 6. It should return this new number. You should call the divide function within the sum function. Do not worry about decimals.
def divide(d):
    d = d/2
    return d
def sum(s):
    a = divide(s) +6
    return a
sum(8)



Create a tuple called olympics with four elements: “Beijing”, “London”, “Rio”, “Tokyo”.
olympics = 'Beijing','London','Rio','Tokyo'


The list below, tuples_lst, is a list of tuples. Create a list of the second elements of each tuple and assign this list to the variable country.
tuples_lst = [('Beijing', 'China', 2008), ('London', 'England', 2012), ('Rio', 'Brazil', 2016, 'Current'), ('Tokyo', 'Japan', 2020, 'Future')]
country=[]
x=0
for i in tuples_lst:
    x+=1
    country.insert(x,i[1])


With only one line of code, assign the variables city, country, and year to the values of the tuple olymp.
olymp = ('Rio', 'Brazil', 2016)
city, country, year =olymp



Define a function called info with five parameters: name, gender, age, bday_month, and hometown. The function should then return a tuple with all five parameters in that order.
def info(name, gender, age, bday_month, hometown):
    return name, gender, age, bday_month, hometown


Given is the dictionary, gold, which shows the country and the number of gold medals they have earned so far in the 2016 Olympics. Create a list, num_medals, that contains only the number of medals for each country. You must use the .items() method. Note: The .items() method provides a list of tuples. Do not use .keys() method.
gold = {'USA':31, 'Great Britain':19, 'China':19, 'Germany':13, 'Russia':12, 'Japan':10, 'France':8, 'Italy':8}
num_medals=[]
c=0
for k,v in gold.items():
    c+=1
    num_medals.insert(c,v)



Week4 


Create a function called mult that has two parameters, the first is required and should be an integer, the second is an optional parameter that can either be a number or a string but whose default is 6. The function should return the first parameter multiplied by the second.
def mult(a,y=6):
    return a*y


The following function, greeting, does not work. Please fix the code so that it runs without error. This only requires one change in the definition of the function.
def greeting(name, greeting="Hello ", excl="!"):
    return greeting + name + excl

print(greeting("Bob"))
print(greeting(""))
print(greeting("Bob", excl="!!!"))


Below is a function, sum, that does not work. Change the function definition so the code works. The function should still have a required parameter, intx, and an optional parameter, intz with a defualt value of 5.
def sum(intx, intz=5):
    return intz + intx


Write a function, test, that takes in three parameters: a required integer, an optional boolean whose default value is True, and an optional dictionary, called dict1, whose default value is {2:3, 4:5, 6:8}. If the boolean parameter is True, the function should test to see if the integer is a key in the dictionary. The value of that key should then be returned. If the boolean parameter is False, return the boolean value “False”.
def test(x, y=True, dict1={2:3, 4:5, 6:8}):
    return y and dict1.get(x, False)



Write a function called checkingIfIn that takes three parameters. The first is a required parameter, which should be a string. The second is an optional parameter called direction with a default value of True. The third is an optional parameter called d that has a default value of {'apple': 2, 'pear': 1, 'fruit': 19, 'orange': 5, 'banana': 3, 'grapes': 2, 'watermelon': 7}. Write the function checkingIfIn so that when the second parameter is True, it checks to see if the first parameter is a key in the third parameter; if it is, return True, otherwise return False.

But if the second paramter is False, then the function should check to see if the first parameter is not a key of the third. If it’s not, the function should return True in this case, and if it is, it should return False.
def checkingIfIn(a, direction = True, d = {'apple': 2, 'pear': 1, 'fruit': 19, 'orange': 5, 'banana': 3, 'grapes': 2, 'watermelon': 7}):
    if direction == True:
        if a in d:
            return True 
        else:
            return False
    else:
        if a not in d:
            return True
        else:
            return False



We have provided the function checkingIfIn such that if the first input parameter is in the third, dictionary, input parameter, then the function returns that value, and otherwise, it returns False. Follow the instructions in the active code window for specific variable assignmemts.
def checkingIfIn(a, direction = True, d = {'apple': 2, 'pear': 1, 'fruit': 19, 'orange': 5, 'banana': 3, 'grapes': 2, 'watermelon': 7}):
    if direction == True:
        if a in d:
            return d[a]
        else:
            return False
    else:
        if a not in d:
            return True
        else:
            return d[a]

# Call the function so that it returns False and assign that function call to the variable c_false
c_false = checkingIfIn('water')
# Call the fucntion so that it returns True and assign it to the variable c_true
c_true = checkingIfIn('apple', False, { 'pear': 1})
# Call the function so that the value of fruit is assigned to the variable fruit_ans
fruit_ans= checkingIfIn('fruit')
# Call the function using the first and third parameter so that the value 8 is assigned to the variable param_check
param_check = checkingIfIn('water', d= {'water':8})

Sort the following string alphabetically, from z to a, and assign it to the variable sorted_letters.
letters = "alwnfiwaksuezlaeiajsdl"
sorted_letters = sorted(letters, reverse=True)


Sort the list below, animals, into alphabetical order, a-z. Save the new list as animals_sorted.
animals = ['elephant', 'cat', 'moose', 'antelope', 'elk', 'rabbit', 'zebra', 'yak', 'salamander', 'deer', 'otter', 'minx', 'giraffe', 'goat', 'cow', 'tiger', 'bear']
animals_sorted = sorted(animals)


The dictionary, medals, shows the medal count for six countries during the Rio Olympics. Sort the country names so they appear alphabetically. Save this list to the variable alphabetical.
medals = {'Japan':41, 'Russia':56, 'South Korea':21, 'United States':121, 'Germany':42, 'China':70}
alphabetical = sorted(medals)


Given the same dictionary, medals, now sort by the medal count. Save the three countries with the highest medal count to the list, top_three.
medals = {'Japan':41, 'Russia':56, 'South Korea':21, 'United States':121, 'Germany':42, 'China':70}
top_three = sorted(medals, key = lambda x: medals[x], reverse=True)[:3]


We have provided the dictionary groceries. You should return a list of its keys, but they should be sorted by their values, from highest to lowest. Save the new list as most_needed.
groceries = {'apples': 5, 'pasta': 3, 'carrots': 12, 'orange juice': 2, 'bananas': 8, 'popcorn': 1, 'salsa': 3, 'cereal': 4, 'coffee': 5, 'granola bars': 15, 'onions': 7, 'rice': 1, 'peanut butter': 2, 'spinach': 9}
most_needed = sorted(groceries, key = lambda x: groceries[x] , reverse=True)


Create a function called last_four that takes in an ID number and returns the last four digits. For example, the number 17573005 should return 3005. Then, use this function to sort the list of ids stored in the variable, ids, from lowest to highest. Save this sorted list in the variable, sorted_ids. Hint: Remember that only strings can be indexed, so conversions may be needed.
ids = [17573005, 17572342, 17579000, 17570002, 17572345, 17579329]
def last_four(x):
    for i in ids:
        return str(x)[5:9]
sorted_ids = sorted(ids, key = last_four)


Sort the list ids by the last four digits of each id. Do this using lambda and not using a defined function. Save this sorted list in the variable sorted_id.
ids = [17573005, 17572342, 17579000, 17570002, 17572345, 17579329]
sorted_id = sorted(ids, key = lambda x: str(x)[-4:])


Sort the following list by each element’s second letter a to z. Do so by using lambda. Assign the resulting value to the variable lambda_sort.
ex_lst = ['hi', 'how are you', 'bye', 'apple', 'zebra', 'dance']
lambda_sort = sorted(ex_lst, key = lambda x: x[1])
